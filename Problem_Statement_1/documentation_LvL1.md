# My Experience
I am new to coding. I have only about a month of experience with Python, so I didn’t have much idea about ASCII values. This assignment motivated me to look them up online and learn more about them.
ASCII values are a set of numbers assigned to letters so that the computer can process them in binary. I learned a lot while doing the assignment by researching online.

# The Procedure I Used
Our first challenge was to create a list of the letters from the user input.
I used the list() function to do this. Then, we had to convert the letters to ASCII values.
I used the ord() function paired with a for loop to access every letter in the list.
Once I had a list of ASCII values, I could change the word to the coded word by accessing every letter in the list and adding the required number — in this case, I chose 5.
For the edge conditions, I subtracted the required number to get the correct answer.
By using if and elif statements, I made sure the ASCII values stayed within the correct bounds.
Now that we had a list of numbers for the coded word, all that was left was to recombine them to get the final word back.
I had to learn a new command, join(), to do this. Thus, the required word was formed.
For decoding I followed the same procedure but changed the ASCII ranges a bit. Thus a coded word can be decoded.
